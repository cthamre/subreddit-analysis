# subreddit-analysis
A set of scripts for scraping text via the Reddit api and extracting counts for a list of words as well as other data products.

subreddit_extraction uses PRAW and requires that you set up a reddit account with the reddit API.

I recommend [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRgfgtzIhBQ&ab_channel=sentdex) to get started with PRAW.
